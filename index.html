        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <div class="content">
        <p>The process would be track top 100 (or any other number) artists for a certain period for a certain region. Hence, we need to figure out the genre of the songs for those artists. Also, the top 100 listened song for a location for a certain time would help us detect preferred genre. Since this keeps on changing with time and place we could visualize the trend in music.</p>
